This is just a very small sample application made with NodeJS applying the Nodemailer package, to manage the emails from our own app.

It also uses Express-Handlebars as view engine, express and body parser as middlewares. You can start by installing all of these dependencies with npm -i. Optionally you can install nodemon to watch all the updates in the server more confortably.

All of this was made following the great tutorial by Traversy Media on Youtube, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF9g1825mwk
